# RNAlertTest

Reproduce React Native issue with foreground MainActivity blocking async/await operations.

# Getting Started

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).


>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio respectively.

## Step 3: Reproduce

Click button on a screen. Observe in logs that async/await operation is blocked untill popup is dismissed.
